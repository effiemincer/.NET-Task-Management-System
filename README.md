# dotNet5784_1982_5912

Todo:
- create logic for dependencies (group the tasks in groups of 4 and set dependencies on them in chronological order) - WERE NOT DOING THIS
- - fix the dates for some stuff (every date has to be after the project start date) -- WERE NOT GONNA DO THIS
- maybe get rid of not needed data in dependencies
- add comments to everything





Done:
- add project start and end date
- add resetting those dates
- comment outfunctions in task that change the dates
- add functions to set those dates in config
- Add to test suite 4 - Config and make it that you can choose b/w the 3 functions in config
- initialize project start date and end date
- match all data types to the data source structure: https://dbdiagram.io/d/153007-5784-DO-64d8f90302bd1c4a5eb3b8a5
