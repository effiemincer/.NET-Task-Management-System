# dotNet5784_1982_5912

Todo:
- add project start and end date
- add resetting those dates
- add functions to set those dates in config
- delete functions in task that change the dates
- create logic for dependencies (group the tasks in groups of 4 and set dependencies on them in chronological order
- maybe get rid of not needed data in dependencies
- add comments to everything
- fix the dates for some stuff (every date has to be after the project start date)
- Add to test suite 4 - Config and make it that you can choose b/w the 3 functions in config
